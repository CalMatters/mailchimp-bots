## Issues
#### Create a new issue

Issues are a great place to share bugs, ideas for what could be improved and feature requests. Before creating a new issue, please double check for similar entries. 
* If a related issue exists, please thread any relevant information under that issue as a comment.
* If there are no related issues, you can open a new issue. Please be as descriptive as possible, including images and code where relevant. 

#### Solve an issue
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | ------- |
| bug | Something isn't working |
| duplicate | This issue or pull request already exists |
| help wanted | What the tag says |
| improvement | Not quite a bug but could be better |
| suggestion box | New features or requests |
| wontfix | This will not be worked on |


## Submitting Changes

* Fork the repository. Create a working branch and start with your changes.
* Commit the changes once you are happy with them.
* When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request (PR).
    * Please use the [pull request template](pull_request_template.md). This helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
    * Don't forget to link the PR to an issue if you are solving one.
    * Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
    * We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
    * As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.

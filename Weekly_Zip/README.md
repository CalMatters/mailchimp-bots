## Context
The Weekly Bot was created to report on a newsletter that was sent once a week. The bot ran only once a week, sending metrics to Slack ~3 days after the campaign was sent. 

## Notes
- The bot provides a comparison between the selected campaign and the previous one.
- Since this bot uses a folder ID to filter the campaigns, and only one newsletter was sent per day, the time range was expansive.
